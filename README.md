# Description

In the Yonkers city of New York, there is a lack of data as to which region populates the
most restaurants. This can hurt food enthusiasts who want to settle there as well as those who
prefer eating a diverse meal at restaurants, since they have no way of knowing the optimal
place to settle for the most restaurants if they wish to be able to access the most amount of restaurants near their region.
<br />
The purpose of this project is to provide data of each restaurant cluster throughout Yonkers through machine learning and data visualization.
